<p><strong> Frustrations and Needs: </strong> Margeret is a middle aged suburban mother of two children aged 8 and 12. She is looking for a pet for her family, but due to the fact that her and her husband both work, they are looking for a pet that is able to be left alone for some period of time, they are also looking for a dog that is big enough to act as a guard dog.</p>
<p>Margeret would love to adopt a dog for her family. She has heard horror stories from neighbors about destructive or aggressive dogs that had to be returned to the animal shelter, she would like to able to find a dog that has the right temperament. Margeret's main frustration is that it is very time consuming to sift through various shelter websites in order to find the right dog.</p>
<p><strong>User Story:</strong>Margeret should be able to quickly and easily look through information on dogs that are available for adoption from various shelters on a single website and bookmark the dogs that she is interested in adopting.</p>
